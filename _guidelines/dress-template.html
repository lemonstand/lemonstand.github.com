<h2><a id="dress"></a> Dressing up our styles</h2>

<p>We like to think of our styles in terms of <em>wardrobe</em>. We are hosts to our visitors, readers, and store owners. Our interactions need to be tailored to the experience we're engineering, so we want to be sure we're dressed to impress.</p>

<p>Our interfaces are <em>dressed</em> up in distinct styles to meet specific goals. Each outfit pulls from the same colours, type faces, and styles of whitespace, with variants that focus the interactions to provide specific emotional ties and practical functions.</p>

<ul class="dress-overview">
    <li>
        <h3>Formal elegance</h3>
        <p>This is the suite-and-tie showroom wear. It's all business, with some the adorable LemonStand flaire.</p>
        <p>These styles use a subset of our colours (more muted), include more whitespace and use larger fonts.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h3>Industrial uniform</h3>
        <p>This is the day-to-day workhorse outfit. It's functional, solid, and tidy, focused on getting things done.</p>
        <p>These styles are tighter and segmented in a way that fits user interfaces. They're generally more muted (but not as much as the formal styles).</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h3>Hipster</h3>
        <p>This is a stylish, enticing superset of our styles. It's info-graphicy, colourful, and whitespace appropriate for medium length content.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h3>Party mode</h3>
        <p>When we have something exciting to say or show, we turn on the party mode. It's campy, colourful, and compelling.</p>
        <p>These styles allow any of our colours, icons, and fonts, in any way that is fun, tasteful, and great at getting attention.</p>
    </li>
