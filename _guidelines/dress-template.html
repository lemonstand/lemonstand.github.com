<h2><a id="dress"></a> Dressing up our styles</h2>

<p>We like to think of our visual styles in terms of <em>wardrobe</em>. We are hosts to our visitors, readers, and store owners. Our interactions are tailored to various parts of the experience, so we want to be sure we're hitting the appropriate notes.</p>

<p>Our interfaces are <em>dressed</em> up in distinct styles to meet specific goals. Each stype pulls from the a common set of colours, type faces, and styles of whitespace, with variants to focus the interactions with emotional effects and practical function.</p>

<ul class="panels-2 dress-overview">
    <li>
        <img src="/assets/tuxedo.png" alt="Formal">
        <h3>Formal elegance</h3>
        <p>This is the suite-and-tie showroom wear. It's all business, with some the adorable LemonStand flaire.</p>
        <p>These styles use a subset of our colours (more muted), include more whitespace and use larger fonts.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <img src="/assets/suit.png" alt="">    
        <h3>Industrial uniform</h3>
        <p>This is the day-to-day workhorse outfit. It's functional, solid, and tidy, focused on getting things done.</p>
        <p>These styles are tighter and segmented in a way that fits user interfaces. They're generally more muted (but not as much as the formal styles).</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <img src="/assets/shirt.png" alt="">
        <h3>Hipster</h3>
        <p>This is a stylish, enticing superset of our styles. It's info-graphicy, colourful, and whitespace appropriate for medium length content.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <img src="/assets/present.png" alt="">        
        <h3>Party mode</h3>
        <p>When we have something exciting to say or show, we turn on the party mode. It's campy, colourful, and compelling.</p>
        <p>These styles allow any of our colours, icons, and fonts, in any way that is fun, tasteful, and great at getting attention.</p>
    </li>
